                        In my Game Programming course this semester, we've been learning how to re-create classic games from over the years. 
                        From the original NES to the Game Boy Color, I've always enjoyed playing 8-bit video games. My final project will likely 
                        have an 8-bit aesthetic to it.

                        In Security, we've been working with Cisco Packet Tracer over the last few months. From configuring topologies 
                        to determining access lists, this application has been a good tool for learning about network security. For anyone interested 
                        in networking, this course has been a good eye-opener about providing security needs.

                        In Application Development II, we've been learning about creating Android apps using Kotlin. After finding Java 
                        overcomplicated and error-prone, I've done much better in Kotlin and have had enjoyed working on assignments. 
                        My group's project is a banking app that we've built from scratch and it's been coming along really well.
